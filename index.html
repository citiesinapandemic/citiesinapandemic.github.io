				<h2>We need your help!</h2>
				<p>We are six Austrian students from the University of Innsbruck who are interested in the effects of
					the COVID-19 pandemic on students in Kuala Lumpur (KL) and Bangkok (BK). Our study is part of a
					research project at the University of Innsbruck in Austria that deals with urban futures in
					Southeast Asia. There are three main objectives that we follow with our research. First, we want to
					get a deeper insight how the Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions of the government affect the
					daily life of students in KL and BK in general. Our second aim is to find out if and how the
					students’ perception and interaction with their environment has changed since the start of the
					pandemic. Finally, we raise the question if the crisis has led to a reassessment of personal needs
					regarding the city and urban space. In other words, how should future urban planning look like to
					deal with crisis, like a pandemic? <br> <br>

				<h2>It´s your choice!</h2>
				<p>You as students living on site are true experts of your city, and we are excited to get your insight into everyday life during the pandemic. We would be very pleased, if you could support our research! Since each person prefers different ways of communication, we have different activities planned so you can choose on of the following options of participation and let us know what is on your mind and what you think about urban futures.</p>

                <h2>Overview of our Project</h2>
                <p>We are a group of Austrian students that were originally planning to travel to Kuala Lumpur/Malaysia
                    and bangkok/Thailand to get to know city life better and to do research on urban development and
                    planning. <br>
                    Unfortunately, due to Covid-19 and the imposed travel restrictions, the trip has been cancelled.
                    Nevertheless, we are curious about your city and everyday life in your urban environemnt.
                    Furthermore we ware interested in how Covid-19 affects you and your city. Therefore, we would like
                    to invite you to take part in our "remote" research project! Although we are not on site to get in
                    touch with you personally, we prepared different digital tools you can easyl use for sharing your
                    expperiences with us. We have different activities planned so you can choose on of the following
                    options of participation and let us know what is on your mind and what you think about urban
                    futures. <br> <br>
